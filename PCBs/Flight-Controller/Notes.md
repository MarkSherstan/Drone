## Crystal Capacitor Calcs
CL= (CX1 * CX2)/(CX1 + CX2) + CSTRAY
CL = (CX * CX)/(CX + CX) + CSTRAY <= substitute CX for CX1 and CX2 since they equal each other
CL = (CX^2)/(2CX) + CSTRAY
CL = (CX/2) + CSTRAY
CL - CSTRAY = (CX/2)
2*(CL -CSTRAY) = CX

CX1 = CX2 = 2*(CL-CSTRAY)

CSTRAY approx 4pF

22/2 = 11 - 4 = 7 ish

C1, C2 = 2*CL â€“ 2*Cstray

C1, C2 = 2*(CL) - Cstray

load capacitance of crystal * 2 - stray cap pin and trace = cap size
