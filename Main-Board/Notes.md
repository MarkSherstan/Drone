Footprints to make 
- SS1P3L
- Button 
- Crystal (Double check)

To Do:
- Debug port? Extra spare PWM?
- Double check interupt pins and ESC compatible 
- Molex connectors? - ESC and lights connectors?
- Layout 2 layer?
- Name the nets
- Extra receiver port?
- Order pre crimped leads
- Double check actual PWM for the RGB????
- Use JST connectors? Vertical?
- Add reverse polarity? - Key power differently???
