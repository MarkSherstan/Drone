# Drone
Mechanical, electrical, and software package for a custom quadcopter drone.

## Mechanical 

## Electrical
### Flight Controller
### Power Distribution Board 
### Lights 

## Software


## Future Ideas
### Mechanical 
- Over actuated design

### Electrical
- Design custom ESCs
- 3.3 V flight controller (8 MHz suffcient?)
- Polyfuses on outputs
- PDB also ESC (active cooling?) - Have regulated outputs 
- PDB is part of frame (1 Oz copper)
- More powerful chip - RPi / STM32 / 2560 - Internet connection?

### Software 
- Test the crystal: How much time are we loosing? Try different caps.
